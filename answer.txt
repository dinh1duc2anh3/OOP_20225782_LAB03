Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?


Java allows you to create multiple constructors in a class as long as they have 
different parameter lists. This is known as constructor overloading, and it is a 
common practice in Java to provide different ways to initialize objects with 
different sets of parameters. So, yes, Java allows you to create constructor methods 
for DVDs based on title and category, provided they have distinct parameter lists, 
such as different types or a different number of parameters.
