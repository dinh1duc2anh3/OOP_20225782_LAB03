Question:
- Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language? 
	Java is a pass-by-value programming language
	
- After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?

The titles of the objects remain unchanged after calling swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) because Java uses pass-by-value, not pass-by-reference.

- After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?

The title of jungleDVD changes because changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) passes a reference to the jungleDVD object into the method. In Java, objects are passed by reference, so the method modifies the title of the jungleDVD directly.
